PREFACE.

 

THE author, in preparing this Vocabulary to accompany his

virgil, or for use with other editionS, has had two things in
view: first, to supply as much information as was possible in
regard to the history and uses of the Latin wordS, so that the book
should not be a mere key to translate by, but should also furnish
means for the study of the language itself; and, secondly, at the
same time to give or suggest a suitable English expressio-n for

every passage.
In every language which is to be rendered into another, there

may be said to be three classes of meanings to the words: first, the ’

etymological meaning, i.e., the idea that a word presented when it
was first formed or used3 second, the literal meanings, i.e., the ideas
which a word came to have to those who used it in its later develop-
ment3 and, third, the foreign meaning or translation, i.e.‚ the word
expressing the nearest equivalent idea in the language into which one
wishes to translate. of course these three classes of meanings may
happen to coincide3 a word may not have deviated essentially from
'its primitive force, aud this same force may happen to belong to some
similar word in the other language. It is, however, oftener other-
wise3 words have often diverged very far and in many directions
from the primitive conception underlying them, and it is rare that
a word in one language exactly covers the group of ideas which
belongs to the nearest. corresponding word in another3 and this is
especially true in poetry. The author has aimed to keep these
classes. of meanings separate so far as space would permit. For
