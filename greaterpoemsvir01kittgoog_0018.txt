xii Introduction.

period. First : Literature became fashionable. Earlier,
except with a very few persons, such pursuits had been
looked upon as idle or even pernicious, and devotion to them
had brought little or no reward. But Augustus was wise
enough to see in literature a powerful agency in establishing
sound government and securing his own power. He there-
fore gave every encouragement to letters, and his people
followed his example. Everybody of any consequence be·
came a writer or at least a critic. Second : It was a period
of peace, of exhaustion after the great struggles of the civil
warS. Third : Politics had ceased to present a career for
men ambitious of distinction, and Fourth ε There was a real
pride in the well won glories ot Rome, an interest in the
subjects of literary art which prompted expression both in ’
prose and poetry.

But probably the greatest stimulus to literary activity at
Rome came from the gradual introduction of the literature
of Alexandria, which had begun in the last half of the second
century 13.c. The seeds of Greek culture, which were scat-
tered far and wide by the overthrow of Grecian liberty, had
been particularly fruitful in that city. Here two great
libraries were established, and a long line of scholars, critics,
and authors flourished tor centuries. The old literary tradi-
tions were broken 3 civilization had become more complex,
and literature assumed a distinctly modern tone. There was
a great revival of learning, and writers tried their hand at
almost every form of composition, —learned treatise, history,
epic, lyriC, elegiae, didactic poetry, epigram and satire, —in
numerous and voluminous specimenS. The study of this
great body of literature could not but excite the rude but
ambitious Romans to imitation. ’

All these influences, added to a skill in the art of writing
acquired by the long apprenticeship of the Republican period,
contributed to raise Augustan literature to its highest mark.
