Virgil 's Fame. xxix

Among the various and conflicting traditions, there was a
story that AEneaS, after escaping from the sack of Troy,
had taken refuge in Italy. How old this tradition was», and
whence it was derived, is uncertain. It is not found in
Homer or the Cyclic poetS, or in any Greek form. The
story, including the episode of Dido, was treated by Naevius
(3.0. 2 35), who could hardly have invented it. It was
alluded to by Ennius (born 13.C. 240), and had been adopted
as a favorite theory before the time of Augustus, Virgil
supplements it with details drawn from local tradition, and
with many of his own manufacture; and in this way has
connected the imperial times with the age of. gods and
heroeS, and formed a sort of background on which the later
history is briefly sketched.

VIRGIL'S FAME.

V1RG1L's EARLv FAME.—Even before the composition
of the AEneid, Virgil had gained a place among the first
in Roman literature. Horace speaks of him as a personal
friend, with love and admiration. The fame of the AEneid
began even before the work was completed. And after his
death, Virgil speedily became, next to Homer, the great
poet of antiquity. His influence shows itself in all succeed-
ing Latin literature, as well in prose as in poetry. Almost
every writer refers to him as the great genius of the nation.
His writings became one of the chief instruments of a
liberal education. “From the time of his death till the
extinction of ancient classical culture, there was a regular
series of rhetoricians and grammarians who lectured and
wrote treatises on his various poemS.'' The interest in his
works survived in some degree the decay of classical learn-
ing. They preserved 'the spark that at the revival of letters
was to burst out into a flame to light and warm the world.
