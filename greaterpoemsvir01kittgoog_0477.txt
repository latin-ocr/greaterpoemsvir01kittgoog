20. Androgei: Androge05‚ son of Minos, on account of the envy of
the AthenianS, was sent by AEgeus to encounter the Marathonian bull,

by which he was slain. His death was avenged, and the Athenians
were compelled to send yearly seven boys and seven girls to be devoured

by the Minotaur. (See Gayley‚ Classic Mytlzs, pp. 260-265‚ where there
is a translation of part of CatulluS, lxiv, giving an account of the victory
of Thesus over the Minotaur.) The sculptures on the temple gates
represent first two scenes at Athens: (1) the death of Androgeos and
(2) the drawing of lots to determine the victims to be sent to Crete;
then two scenes in Crete: (3) Pasiphae, (4) the Labyrinth, with Theseus
and Ariadne. Cf. Spenser’s description of the gate of the Bower of
Bliss (Faery Queen, ii. 12. 44):

Yt framed was of precious yvory,

That seemd a worke of admirable witt3

And therein all the famous history

Of J ason and Medea was ywritt3

Her mighty charmes, her furious loving fitt;

His goodly conquest of the golden fleece,

His falsed fayth, and love too lightly flitt3

The wondred Argo, which in venturous peece

First through the Euxine seas bare all the flowr of Greece.
