xl Directions for R ending.

Here, though the caesura might be in the third foot, yet
the division of the verses as marked fits the sense better.

Tum genus omne tuum et ΙΙ quae dentur moenia disces.

Here there is no natural caesura except after et, although
this word belongs to and connects the following. (See above.)

It may be remarked that the verses most agreeable to the
ear are those in which dactyls are more numerou5‚ or alternate
with spondees3 otherwise—especially if the last foot but
one is a spondee (spondaic verse)— a slow and labored
movement is given to the line, which is, however, ⁴often
very expressive (see Ecl. iv. 49 ; AEn. ii. 463-466).

It is not known with certainty how elided syllables were
treated in reading. It is probable‚ however, that the vowels
and diphthongs were so slurred over as to make them
equivalent to y and w, and that when m was cut off it left a
nasal sound‚ which was still audible enough to give a nasal
character to the syllable.1 Where‚ as in Ecl. i. 13, elision
interferes with the main caesura, the line may be'read with‘-
out any main caesura, or the sense may be sacrificed to the
form of the verse.

The hexameter is not native to the Latin language‚ bu't is
borrowed from the Greek. Hence all poetry written in hexa-
meters has more or less an artificial character, and requires a
conventional poetic, diction. The rules of the metre ex-
clude many words : all, for example, in which a single short
syllable comes between two long ones (as in all the cases of
aequi‘tas, longitzidc), and similar words3 all except the nom. and
voe. sing. of insiila, unless the last syllable can be removed
by elision 3 many forms of verb-inflection (as fe‘cb'rant) ; and
all forms where more than two short syllables come to-
