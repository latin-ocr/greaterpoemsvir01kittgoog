264 NoteS. [AEnizm.

378. retro repressit, checked .· strictly tautological, but such repetition
for emphasis is common in all languages; cf„ for example, Shakspere,
Love's Labor ’s Lost, ii. 1. 159: ‘⁴ I'll repay it back.''

380. nitens, treadmg. —reffigitt notice that this verb is transitive
in Latin. The perfect is used to express the moment when the man
has just recoiled in his sear. — Cf. Parnell, The Her-mit:

As one who spies a serpent in his way,

Glist'ning and basking in the summer ray,
Disorder’d stops to ehun the danger near,

Then walka with faintness on and looks with far.

382. abibat, was about to flee: §4712 c (277, c); B. 260, 33 G. 2333
H· 534, 2 (469, Ῑ); ΗΓΒ· 484.

383. circumfundimur, plunge into: strictly, in the “middle’' sense,
‘⁴ surround ourselves with.‘'

384. passim: i.e. in all parts of the scene of battle.

386. successu animisque (abl. of cause), exuliarit with the courage os
success (hendiadys): §404 (245); B. 2193 G. 4083 H. 475 (416); H.-B.
444, a·

388. dextra, auspist‘ous: we should expect dextram, but the word is
made more lively by agreeing with subject. Cf. note on v. 54.

389. insignia, equipments : helmets, shields, ete„ by which their
wearers may be distinguished.

390. dolus, ete.: sc. sit in a double question; ξ 335, d (211, d); B.
162, 23 G. 458; H. 380, 3 (353, 2); H.-B. 234, iii.—in hoste, in deal·
ing with an enemy (lit. in the case of an enemy, a very common meaning
of in).

392. clipei insigne decorum, the gorgeous blazonry qs his shield. The
expression is somewhat like lapsus rotarum (v. 235), though more
complicated; it is, however, natural enough in poetry. ’

393. induitur: see note to collecta, i. 320; cf. ii. 275.

394. ipse Dymas, Dymas too.

396. haud numine nostro (abl. of manner), with nofavoring divini-
ties, i.e. the plan was destined to be fatal, as the sequel showed. This
is, on the whole, the best meaning of this disputed passage. Possibly,
however, the idea that being under the Greek ensign, as it were, they
were not under their own divinitieS, was in Virgil’s mind; for it is a
privilege of poetry to mean two things at once; in other wordS, what in
a jest would be a pun may in serious language be a poetic suggestion.
Cf. invitis divis: v. 402.—nostro: δ 302, b (197, b); G. 312. πῶς H.
501, 1 (447, Ν.1); Η.-Β. 264, 3, a.
