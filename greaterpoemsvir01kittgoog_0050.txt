ictus must fall on -am. We ought to know next from our
inflexions that the o of the dative and ablative is long. If
we d0, we shall see that -to must receive a new ictus, We
should always say prbsugus in prose, consequently the quan-
tity of the u is determined as short. So an ictus must
come on -gua The standing rhythm of the verse will finish
the line correctly‚ since i before a cannot be long and
hence cannot be anything but a consonant (just as we
should say in English, a million zhtrziders) ifthe verse is to
have only six feet. So we are sure that it is

ftalilam salto profulgus Lalviniaque 1 venit.

In the next line; as we pronounce litora in prose, o is
short, and a is a neuter plural ending besideS, and there-
fore short. The rest of the line goes by the rule of a
vowel before two consonantS, if we remember to cut off
the -um before ille. The next line is determined by sdpemm
and me'morem‚ which show short penults in pronunciation.

The rules already given enable us to read the fifth line,
except that ng‘is might give some trouble if it were not so
near the end that we can see that the line could not read
in any other way.

The enclitic -qub' makes it impossible to go astray on the
sixth line. , ’

Thus our three main rules with three very common finaIS,
and three common penults‚ that we can hardly help having
pronounced before, enable us to read the first six lineS.

A very few more rules of the same sort would determine the
metre through the whole book. Of course if students have'
been wont to pronounce quantitatively‚ reading will be easier
still. A few irregularities will be found, which will, however,
manage themselves, because there is in general only one
possible way to read the lines, A little practice will make
