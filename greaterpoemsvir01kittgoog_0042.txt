and it often happens that the dictionary in its effort to
make plain the ultimate meaning takes out the vivid figure
and gives us only the prosaic result. Always try therefore
to see what the literal meaning of the words is, and in com-
bining thern you will be almost sure to get an image. Do
not run down the column of the dictionary for a translation
till you have tried to make the literal meaning yield a sense,
and then ordinarily some suitable translation will occur to
you. The meaning of a word is something quite distinct
from its translation and may be very different from it.
Languages differ so much in their way of taking hold of
ideas, that to produce the same effect or call up the same
image in one as in the other, an entirely different form of ex·
pression must often be used. Such a sentence as spumas salis
aere ruebant expresses a definite figure. The poet conceives
the bronze-armed prow as really digging up the foam, and
this is best arrived at through the simplest meaning of rue,
which is αἰὲς. The derived senses of undermine, cause to fall,
and sall, have so obscured the literal signification of the word
that it is often hard to see what it means. , But Virgil has
perhaps more than any other poet the consciousness of the
tangible literal ideas in word5‚ and it is always best to
look for such i'deas when there is any difficulty in getting
at his exact conception. Our word plough up presents a
corresponding figure and may well be used in translation.
Do not be turned aside by the apparent absurdity of a figure.
The poet's environing customs and his range of ideas are
often quite different from our own, and sometimes a little
reflection will show that a figure is natural to him when it is
not at all so to us. Ἴ In such a case the nearest figure in
English should be chosen.

The Syntax of Virgil‚ in general, is much easier and
simplet than that of most prose writerS, and there are few
difficulties of construction except where the ellipsis of words
