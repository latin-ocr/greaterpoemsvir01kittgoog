xx Introduction.

Rhodes as by the Iliad and Odyssey. The effect of these
writers accounts for the distinct modern tone in Virgil's
workS, so different from the simple barbarism of Homer.
He represents an entirely new civilization‚ -— the beginning
of European modes of thought and feeling.

Especially is this evidenced in the dramatic episode of
Dido, which marks the changed position which woman took
in the Alexandrian literature. In contrast with the mere
chattels of the early Greek workS, Dido is a modern woman.
The actionS, the speech, and the whole play of emotions of
all the characters in that episode distinctly belong to the
later civilization (cf. p. 307). This was all prepared for by
the poetry of the Alexandrian period, in which the char-
acters are drawn with true civilized complexsty, and in
which love, in the modern romantic sense, is a fundamental
theme - a treatment utterly foreign to the Greek classic
literature.

Another clear indication of this new spirit is found in the
fact that the epithetS, which in Homer seem to express in an
artless manner a single obvious impression in a simple mind,
disappear later, or, if used at all, appear affected and otiose.
So through this Alexandrian influence, Virgil is, as it were,
the first of the moderns, and is only an ancient writer in
that his formal models belong to the heroic age. His real
inspiration comes from a state of society and habits of mind
infinitely nearer to our own than were those of classic
Greece.

CARMINA MINORA.—The Carmina Asinam, not printed
in this edition, are of such uncertain authorship and have
had so little influence on later literature, that it seems un-
necessary to discuss their character here.
