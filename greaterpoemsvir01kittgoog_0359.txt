11. 2⁷4] The AEneid. 259

258. utero: locutive abL—Dmoe . . . clun-tra, lets loose the Greeks
from their pine-wood prison. As the verb lexat can apply in slightly dif-
ferent senses to both Dmoe and claustra, the zeugma, always a favorite
form of expression (cf. notes on i. 3 56, ii. 54), is preferred to the ablative
of separation (chaonia)

2 59· lexat is in the same construction as extulerat, but the action of
the latter verb precedes and that of the former is brought forward to
present time (hist. pres.) ς hence the great difference of tense. —nurem
open air: see ii. 158, iv. 3883 cf. George Peele, Tale qs Tay, vv. 414-

417:

The monstroue horse, that in his spacious sides
A traitorous throng of subtile Grecians hides,
’Gan now discharge his vast and hideous load
And silently disperse his strength nbroad.

263. primus nachon: Machaon, son of AEsculapius; primus may
be a translation of ἀριστεύοντα (11. xi. 506), or may perhaps mean among
thefirst.

264. doli ε i.e. the horse. N otice the variety of words virgil uses to

266. portis: abl, of means.

267. conscia, allied‚ knowing each other's planS.

268. tempus eret: this, with nox erat, has been observed to be a

From henven'e night into mens heavy eyes,
In the forgettulneu οἱ sleepe doth drowne
The ardun thought os mortall miseriesg

‘I'hen did a ‘host before mine eyes appare.

A pallid ghost, with bearing dolorous, —

Her face, alas! how changed from what had been l—
“ Flee, flee 1¹² ehe cried.
