xxviii Introduction.

perish in the forests of Mount Ida. Being rescued‚ he lived
as a shepherd on the mountain, where he was visited by the
three great goddesses— Hera (suno), Pallas, and Aphrodite
(Venus) — to award the prize of beauty among them, the gol-
den apple of discord. His reward for bestowing the prize on
Venus was to be the most beautiful of living women for his
bride. ο This was Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta,
daughter of Zeus (Jupiter) and Leda; and a wrong to her
was to be revenged by all the heroes and chiefs of Greece,
who had been her suitorS. Paris visited Sparta, “with flower-
embroidered raiment and bright in gold‚'' and carried her
away to Troy. Hence the famous ten years' siege and the
destruction of the sacred city.

About the tale of Troy had gathered a vast body of
legendary adventure, contained in the “Cyclic PoetS,'' the
festal odes, the Attic Tragedies, and, above all, in the great
Homeric poems‚ the Iliad and Odyssey. The Iliad is but
an episode of the war. It tells the disasters which besell
the Grecian army from the wrath of Achilles, its most
famous champion, against Agamemnon, brother of Mene-
lauS, ‘and leader of the host. Achilles' absence brings the
other heroes to the front,—the aged Nestor, wisest of
men3 Idomeneus of Crete3 the wily Odysseus (Ulysscs),
king of Ithaca3 Ajax· Oileus; the mightier Ajax, son of
Telamon3 his brother Teucer; and Diomed (Tydides),
youngest and bravest of them all; with the two sons of
AtreuS‚ — Menelaus, and Agamemnon, “lord of men.'' The
poem ends with the death and burial of Hector, the noblest
champion of Troy, who is slain by Achilles in revenge for
the death of his friend Patroclus. The return of Ulysses
to Ithaca, after his long wanderings, is the subject of the
OdysseuS, which contains also the story of the capture of
Troy by the stratagem of the wooden horse, and of the fate
of several other Grecian chiefs beside UlysseS.
