3 18 NoteS. [AEntm.

3. animo: dative; see iii. 678, note—multa, etc.: the four points
are moral character (thrtus) nobility (gentis honos), personal beauty
(voltus), eloquence (verba).

6. postera: belongs to Aurora— Phoebea. of Phoebus (the regular
use of the possessive adjective). Apollo is naturally constantly identi-
fied with the sun.

8. cum adloquitur: cf. iii. 10, note. —male sana: see ii. 23, note.—
. sororem: 5 370, b (228, a); B. 179, 2; G. 3313 H.-B. 391, 2.

9. suspensam, in my anxie& .· cf. cura, above.

ιο. quis, etc.: as often happens in Latin, there are here two clauses
compressed into one, Who is this, etc., who, etc.?

1 1. quem: predicate apposition. — quam forti pectore et armis (abl.
of quality), how brave his beart and [deeds of] arms! It is best to take
the words as referring to moral qualitieS, since timot (cf. v. 13) is obvi-
ously opposed to them. The whole thus becomes much more striking.
‘⁶ What a noble mien‚ what an heroic soul and doughty deedsl he must
be of divine descent, for common souls are recognized by fear.'' At
this point quibua, etc., is prompted by compassion, as the first exclama-
tion is by admiration ς and then v. 1 5 gives the natural conclusion. The
rendering imitated by Tennyson is less satisfactory: “O noble breast
and all-puissant arms ’⁹ (Idylls qs the Χίης).

12. equidem, I 'm sure. —vana, idle, i.e. groundlesS.

13. degeneres: the emphasis on degeneres gives the passage a mean-
ing different from the apparent sense of the words and is best reproduced
in English by changing to the passive ε “ ignoble souls are betrayed by
fear''; the implication is that AEneas' soul is not degener, since he is
brave. —rexhaustax observe the literal sense underlying the figure.

15· animo: locative abl.

16. ne . . . vellem, nottowisla‚ etc.:§563,d(331,d); B. 295,4; G. 546:

G. 346, N.⁶; H.428, 3 (385, 4. 3) ς Η.-Β. 363, 2, c. —vincloz abl. of manner.

17. mortee with deceptam.

18· pertaesum, utterly weary: impers.; see ᾖ 208, b, N. (146, b, N.);
cf. 11:13. 287.—taedae: ἕ 354, b (221, b); B. 209, ις G. 3773 H. 457,
3, 5 (409, iii, 410, iv, N.¹); H.-B. 352, 1. Torches were borne before the
bridal pair in the marriage procession‚ and Hymenaeus, the god of mar—
riage, is represented with a torch (see vv. 167 (note), 338-339). cf.

They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke
Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked.
