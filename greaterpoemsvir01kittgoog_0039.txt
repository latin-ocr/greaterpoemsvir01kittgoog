consciously, we judge all works in the grand style, and,
through the effect he produced on our older literature, his

MANuscmPTs. ⁴

The early popularity of Virgil has secured the transmission
of his works to us in a larger number of manuscripts than
those of almost any other ancient writer. The history of
the text is too long for this place, but it may be found well
set forth in Ribbeck's Prolegomena to Virgil. The oldest
and most important MSS. are seven, written in capitaIS‚

varying in extent from a few leaves to the almost complete
works. The practically complete ones are :—

The Medicean, 5th century, now in F lorence (M).
The Palatine, 4th to 5th century, now in the Vatican (P).
The vatican, 4th to 5th century, now in the Vatican (R). ,

The incomplete ones are :—

Schedae vaticanae, 2d century, now in the Vatican (F).
Schedae Sangallenses (G).

Schedae Veronenses (V).

Three Berlin Leaves (A).

Of the incomplete, the best is F. Other good, but later,
manuscriptS, in cursive hand, are :—

Codex GudianuS, 9th century (γ). η
Three Berne MSS„ 9th to loth century (a, b, c).
Codex Minoraugiensis, roth to 12th century (m).

Besides these, there are a host of later cursive manu-
scripts. All are supposed to have come from ,one source,

being copied from an archetype, not of the best, and filled
with glosses and interpolation&
