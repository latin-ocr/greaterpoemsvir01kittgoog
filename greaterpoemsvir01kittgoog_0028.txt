xxii Introduction.

efforts popular among the better class at Rome, who were
familiar with this development of literature. But, either
impelled by his own genius or stimulated by the counsels of
the cultivated patrons whose ear he gained by the delightful
charm of these works, he soon abandoned this form for a
more sustained and lofty effort. Hence he only wrote ten
of these charming pieces, Α

It is not surprising that Virgil should have thus chosen
the models of his first poetic essayS. Nor is it strange that
these efforts should have at once met with appreciation and
favor and drawn upon him the attention of the great Augustan
literary circle. Several times since in the history of litera-
ture has the same phenomenon appeared, notably under
Louis XIV. in France and in the reign of Queen Anne in
England. At both these epochs a highly cultivated court,
satiated with all sorts of pleasureS, found especial delight
in conventional pastoral poetry. These little pieces ot Virgil
are copies of far superior originals, but they have a perfectiori

have gained for them the rank of models in their kind.

more easily to fix them in the memory. In other words, the ob-
ject of the poet was to instruct. The somewhat dry precepts
of Hesiod bear this stamp. This object had, however, been
more or less lost sight of in the later Greek didactic poetry,
