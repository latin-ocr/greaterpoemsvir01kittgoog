Boox VI.

The main action of this book, the visit to the world of Shades, is
expanded from the narratives of Ulysses in the eleventh book of the
Odyssey. But there are striking differences in the main conception.
Ulysses‚ in a region vaguely indicated as at the ends of the earth, beyond
the Ocean stream, simply offers sacrifice and digs a trench about which
the ghosts crowd eager for the victims’ blood, and so hold converse
with him. In Virgil the locality is no longer vague. The shades inhabit
a vast underground realm of which the entrance is marked by the sulphur
springs and caverns near the Bay of N aples. This under-world has well-
defined regions of the tormented and the blessed, according to the more
developed though philosophie and skeptic opinion of the Augustan age.
The whole does not represent a consistent general conception of the
under-world, but seems to be made up of ideas drawn from many quarterS.
The passage from v. 637 on bears marks of a conception of the under·
world drawn from the MysterieS‚ and Virgil, like many educated Romans,
had probably been initiated into the Mysteries of Eleusis. Much of
the philosophy is Platonism or Stoic pantheism3 and the theory of the
vision appears to include the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis,
Cf. Ovid, Met. xv. 1—487.

In imitation of Virgil the episode of a visit to the under-world has been
a favorite device of modern poetry, and, in such caseS, many features oi
Virgil's description have usually been borrowed. The most famous·
modern instance is Dante's Inferna, in which Virgil himself is brought
in as the poet’s guide through Hell. For examples from English litera·
ture see Spenser, Faery Queen, i. 5. 31—44 (Descent of Night and Duessa),
ii. 7. 20-66 (Cave of Mammon)‚ Pope, Dunciad‚ iii. 13 ff. One of the
most remarkable English imitations of the descent to Hades is Thomas
Sackville‘s Induction (1563) to The Mirrorsor Magirtrates. The plan
of the Affirror is to introduce one after another the ghosts of unfortunate
“ princes and magistrates ’' who shall in person give an account of their
crimes or misfortunes. The Induction represents the author as conducted
to Hades by the goddess Sorrow, as AEneas by the priesteSS. The ghosts
swarm about them, and Henry, Duke of Buckingham, begins the series

of tragic taleS,

was situated on the coast, a few miles west of NapleS, where its remains
are still to be seen. In its foundation Chalcis of Euboea was united
with Cyme in Asia Minor, —hence the nam’e Cumae: the assigned date
