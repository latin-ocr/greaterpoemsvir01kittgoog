54. laeva, as applied to fata, means unpropitious,· as applied to
mens, it means dull, blinded. The first meaning is derived from the
language of augury. An appearance on the left was inauspicious (cf.
sinister) among the GreekS, whom Virgil here follows, though originally
the left was the fortunate quarter among the Romans Cf. Ben Jonson,
Silent Woman, iii. 2: ⁴‘ That would not be put off with left-handed
cries.’' The second meaning comes from the awkwardness (gaucherie)
of the left hand. Such uses of words in a double sense are avoided in
modern style, and in the classics we explain them by the so—called rhe-
torical figure zeugma ,· but they probably seemed neither irregular nor
objectionable to the ancients (see i. 356, note).
