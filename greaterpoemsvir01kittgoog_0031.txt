kind of ballads that here concern us. The essentials of a
genuine ballad are, that it should tell a story, should be
meant for singing‚ and should have no author. To discuss
this last requirement would be to open the whole question
of popular (i.e.‚ folk) literature. Here it is enough to define
the having no author as meaning that the ballad must· have
been handed ‚down by oral tradition, and must in some
fashion have taken its origin from the life, the belief, the
traditions of the people. It is not, and cannot be, the
conscious artistic work of a literary class or a literary man.
A number of such ballads as this, each dealing with an epi·
sode in the life of· a legendary character (whether originally
historical or not) may become associated into a sort of cycle,
also without the intervention of distinctly literary art. This
cycle is, in a sense, already an epic; but it is an epic loosely
constructed, and ready at any minute to fall to pieces into
parts roughly corresponding to the ballads of which it is made
up, or, as is more frequently the case, to combine with other
similar cycles in making up a larger poem approaehing still
nearer to the finished epic. After a sufficient number of
syntheses‚ dissolving5‚ and re-combinations (which, in any
given case, become so complicated, if there is any long period
of time to consider, that it is impossible to trace them in
detail), an epicis the result. At almost any stage in this
development, conscious art, as represented by the profes·
sional minstrel, may intervene; and, in most caseS, before
the popular epics assume a form sufficiently definite to reach
civilized ears or to be written down, literature, in the person
of the combiner and codifier, has exercised its artificial in-
fluence on them. Some of these processes may be seen in that
little epic, the old English Gest of Robin Hood. This was
clearly put into its present form by some minstrel or writer
of the 15th century who had a genuine feeling for the ballad.
The materials with which he worked were narrative songs
