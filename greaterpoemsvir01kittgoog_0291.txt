THE AENEID.

 

Boon 1.

VERsEs 1-33 are introductory, giving the subject and the occasion.
The action begins with Juno’s soliloquy. Cf. the beginning of Para-
dise Lost, where vv. 1-26 correspond to AEn. i. 1-7 (general subject),
vv. 27-33 to i. 8-11 (invocation, with an inquiry)‚ vv. 34-49 to i. 12-33
(answer to the inquiry)‚ and the action begins with v. 50. The opening
stanzas of Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered are a close imitation of Virgil’s
introduction.

It will add greatly to the understanding and interest of the AEneid
to consult the corresponding passages in Homer, which are frequently
cited, with references to Bryant's translation (Bry.). In general, the first
six books have a certain correspond'ence with the Odyssey, and the last
six with the Iliad; but the direct allusions to the Iliad are much more
frequent in the former portion. '

The following verses (generally regarded as spurious) are sometimes
prefixed to the AEneid:

Ide ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena
Carmen, et egressus silvis vicina coegi

⁴ Ut quamvis avido parerent arva colono,
Gratum opus agricolis .· at nunc horrentia Martis.

These have been often imitated, as by Spenser‚ Faery Queen, i. 1

(ΡΙ-οδω) · Lol 1, the man whose Muse whylome did maske,
As time her taught, in lowly shephard's weeds,
Am now enforst, a farre unfitter taske,

For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine oaten reede,
And sing of knights' and ladies' gentle deeds.

Cf. also the beginning of Milton‘s paradise Regained and of Cowper's
Task.

The grammate cited are thone of Allen and-Greenough (ς), Bennett (13.),
Gildereleeve (0.), Har-lmen (H.), end Hale end nucum-130. References in
menthe-ee ere to the old editions.
