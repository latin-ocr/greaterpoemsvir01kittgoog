4 Preface.

this purpose the etymological meaning, where it may not be directly
deduced from the etymology, has been given first in a parenthesis,
Then follow the literal meaningS, as nearly as possible in the sup-
posed order of development, with such hints as could be given of
the connection of ideas. Such renderings as seemed to be neces-
sary in English, but which did not accord with the Latin concep-
tion, have been given in their connection as examples. In this
way it is hoped the pupil or teacher may find a good English
expression without losing sight of the Latin conception, which is,
after all, the most important of the three classes of meanings.

Further, an expression rendered by a bare representation of its
ultimate mechanical equivalent, often loses not only all its poetry,
but also the whole conception 35 it presented itself to the mind of
the original speaker. ι

Take such a case as fors dicta rqfutd3 the poet undoubtedly means

the calamity supposed3 a force which vaguely underlies the expres-

that the desired result has been attained in all oeseS, but the idea
has been constantly kept in view. Nor is it supposed that the
expressions given are the only suitable ones, but it is hoped that
they will be found suggestive.

In regard to the etymology, which occupies more space than is

usual in such bookS, the author has wished to show ’ not merely ”

the kinship of words looseiy, but, if possible, the precise manner
in which one word has been formed from another. The fact is
often overlooked that the Latin language, as we have it, is the growth
of many centuria, during which forms have grown up and given
