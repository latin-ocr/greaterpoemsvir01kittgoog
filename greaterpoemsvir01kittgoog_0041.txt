DIRECTIONS FOR READING.

 

RANSLATION. — As Virgil’s works have had the fort·

une to be a school-book from the earliest times and

are still the first Latin poetry put into the hands of many
boyS‚ and often the only Latin poetry‚ a few suggestions may
be given to beginners as to the proper way of studying the
author. Seein the first place exactly what figure the poet
had present in his mind. Poetry has always vivid, forcible
conceptions or it is not poetry. In ordinary prose, as well
as in conversation, effete metaphors such as make up the
great stock of words in a language‚ serve to express ideas
well enough. In careless conversation ‘catch on ' means
only understand,· ‘ start in ’ means merely bqginst and we are
unconscious of the figurative nature of these phraseS. But it
is characteristic of poetry to retain the consciousness of figura-
tive expressions, and when the old ones have faded out to
make new ones that shall be vivid. Thus in Aen. i. 105, Vir-
gil says, insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons. What he
has in his mind is that when the ship broaches to, there
comes an enormous wave all at once in a mass (cumulo),
not gradually as water ordinarily comes, and that in its
approach it forms a huge wall or precipiee, such as is often
seen where a mountain is broken down on one side. This
is a real image to the poet's mind, not a mere fashion of
speech such as we have in prose, as illustrated above. Now
to read poetry with any advantage we must get before our
own minds the ‘same image which appeared to the poet,

¹ Colloqulal expressions are taken as example· because lt is in the case of
meh expressions that we soonest forget the original (uteral) meaning.
