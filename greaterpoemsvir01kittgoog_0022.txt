xvi Introduction.

possession of his estate (see Ecl. i..)

But new troubles followed in the State, and a new division
of lands. Pollio had taken part with Antony, and was dis-

Sic vos non vobis—

the latter four times repeated. Bathyllus owned himself'
unable to fill them out3 and Virgil proved himself the author-

by completing them as follows: -
