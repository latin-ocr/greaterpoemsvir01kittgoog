VIRGIL’S LATER F ΑΜΕ. -Though Ovid was the favorite
Latin poet of the Middle Ages, yet Virgil was never wholly
neglected. The AEneid was held in high esteem not so
much for its artistic perfection as for the information which
it furnished concerning the “matter of Troy,'' one of the
main branches of rnediaeval ‚romantic material. The fact
that some of the leading nations of Western Europe thought
themselves descended from the Trojans assured the AEneid
of an interested reading wherever there was culture enough
to understand it. In the twelfth century the story was
worked over into the old F rench “Romance of AEneaS,''
which, though it seems to us like a parody, enjoyed con·
siderable popularity, and was not without influence on
European literature.

Virgil himself was transformed by the ignorance of the
Middle Ages into a mythical person endowed with magical
powers, His works were used for lots (sortes Vergiliana),
as indeed they had been even in later classical times. His
name, popularly etymologized as from virga, “magic wand,'’
and his mother's name, Magia, helped the propagation of
the idea. He became a wonderful sorcerer, but, contrary
to the ordinary idea of such personageS‚ one of beneficent
disposition. On the strength of his fourth Eclogue he was
regarded as a prophet. The method of allegorical interpre-
tation was also applied to the AEneid. Bernard of ChartreS,
a teacher of the 12th century, declares that Virgil “ inasmuch
as he is a philosopher, describes human life under the guise
of the history of AEneas, who is the symbol of the soul.'' In
accordance with these„ views Dante calls Virgil ‘⁴ the sea of
all knowledge'’ and “ the sage who knew all things.''

It was this belief in Virgil as a philosopher and prophet,
as well as admiration for his art, that made Dante select him
for his guide through the world below, the most famous use
of his name in all (later) literature.
