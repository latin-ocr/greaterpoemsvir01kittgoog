111. 76.] Τ lte AEneid. 287

62. instauramus: the technical word for a renewal of any imperfect
ceremonies; the funeral rites (funus) had, of course, been cut short, if
not omitted altogether, by the murderer. Their due performance was
thought to lay the ghost. See the long description of the funeral of
Misenus in vi. 177-235, with the notes.

63. Manibus: the Manes are the spirits of the dead considered as
inhabiting the Lower World. When conceived as ghosts hovering

about their old homes or haunting the living, they are lemures or larvae.
Cf. Herrick, To the Shade qs his Fatlter:

Behold, behold, 1 bring
Uuto thy ghost th’ effused offering,
And look, what smallage, nightshade, cypress, γον,
Unto the shades have been, or now are due,
Here 1 devote.

64. atra cupresso: so vi. 216: ferales cupressos. Cf. Davenant,
Gondibert, ii. 4:

The palace seems all hid in cypress boughs, —

From ancient lore of man’s mortality
The type, for where ’t is lopped it never grows.

66. inferimus: a sacrificial terrm—lacte: ᾖ 403, d (244, e); G. 396,
N.⁸; H. 470, 1 (415, iii); H.-B. 406, 4, α.

67-68. animam . . . condimus, etc„ we lay the [perturbed] spirit:
as we say “to lay a ghost.” From the expression here it would seem
that the soul was supposed to remain with the body after death; but
compare iv. 705, v. 517, which seem to imply a different idea. The first
view is doubtless the more primitive and less philosophical, and was
retained and confused with the later one. — supremum ciemus, we call
upon him for the last time: cf. ii. 644; for constr.. cf. ii. 630, note.

69. placata dant, render calm (see i. 66, note). The sea is conceived
as personal and so is appeased.

71. deducunt, launch .· their ships were regularly beached while in
port, and this word is the technical term for drawing them into the
water.

73. mari medio, in mid-sea.

74. Nereidum matri: Doris, cf. i. 144, note; Ecl. x. 5.—Neptuno:
Delos is said to have been sacred to Poseidon, until yielded by him to
Latona. Note the two cases of hiatus in this verse.

75. pius, filial, referring to his care of Latona.

76. errantem: it is possible that the little island of Delos from its
position had often eluded the early mariners, and so led to the story
that it was adrift, until its place was fixed by Myconus and GyaruS, to
