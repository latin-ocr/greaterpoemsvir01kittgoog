xxxiv Introduction.

The Editio princeps was published at Rome about 1469.
Since then all classical scholars have been at work, more or
less, upon the text and its explanation, and the editions are
innumerable. Notable is Heyne's edition‚' Leipsie, 1767-
1775. The latest work of German industry is the edition of
Ribbeck, Leipsie, 18 59-1866, who has collected all the lore
known to the world, ‘and prepared a text which is the best
thus far made, but it is disfigured by arbitrary conjectures
and unsupported fancies, The best for English readers is
Conington’S‚ London, 1865, with notes ; the second edition
has the assistance of H. Nettleship. Of the ancient com-
mentaries‚ the most valuable are those of Servius and Don-
atuS. These- have been published many timeS, both with
the works and separately. Of the many works about the
poet, “The Poets of the Augustan Age ε Virgil,'' by W. Y.
Sellar, is the best English book. The article on Virgil in
the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the essay on his genius by E.
Myers, and chap. v. of R. Y. Tyrrell's “Latin Poetry'’
(Boston‚ 1895) may be read with profit.
