Virg il 's Works. xxi

of herdsmen (βουκόλοι), and hence are called Bucolics.
These were first published under the title of Eclogues
(ἐκλογαί, selectiores). In form they are chiefly imitationS‚
often translationS‚ of the Idyls (εῖδύλλια, οι· picture poems) of
Theocritus and the other Greek pastoral poets; but the
scenes often belong to Italy, the occasions to the history of
the time, and the incidents to the poet's own life.

In a highly artificial civilization, such as that of Alexan-
dria and the countn'es connected with it in commercial and
social relations, where the conventionalities of society press
heavily on the freedom of the individual‚ the seclusion and
quiet of rustic life have often from contrast had a special
charm. Men have liked to play at being shepherds or
sarmers, and to dwell in imagination on the simple life,
more or less colored‚ it may be, of persons far removed
from artificial restraintS. This tendency was especially
marked in the Idyls of TheocrituS, Bion, and MoschuS,
poets of that time, about 27 5-2 50 B.c., wh0‚ though not

like the country scenes and dialect stories of to—day, were
(as they still are) highly esteemed for their artistic simplicity
and naturalneSS.

We have some forty short· poems by these authors in the
Epic measure, but with no pretence of Epic grandeur. Still
their shepherd is often apotheosized into a semi-divine per-
sonage named DaphniS, and their idealized realism has the
effect of a human life led by brownies or elveS. Of these
poet3‚ Theocritus was the most famouS, and by tar the larger
part of the extant idyls are attn‘buted to him.

A like simplicity and sweetness of soul and similar con-
ditions of life, a rustic origin within reach of the influence
of a high civilization, seem to have led Virgil to adopt
these poem, and especially TheocrituS, as his models in his
