Virgil ’s Works. xxiii

and the later poets sought to give a higher literary form and a
more elegant dress to subjects which might as well have been
treated in prose if the object had been merely instruction.

It can hardly be supposed that Virgil intended in his
. Georgics to give information to anybody who did not possess
it before. His object must have been rather to give pleasure
by idealizing and ennobling the processes of an art that his
readers were already acquainted with, and possibly to en·
courage the pursuit of the art, so far as an amateur·poetical
treatment of it could do so, by making the pursuit fashionable,
—- not, however, among humble farmers, but among the great
proprietors of land. The Romans had become — for prob-
ably their earliest greatness was commercial — essentially
an agricultural people ; that is, their pride, as in England at
this day, was in the tilling of fine estates and the manage-

on farming, the constant references with pride and pleasure
to this subject in the works of Cicero and others, show that
agriculture, next to war and politiCS, was the favorite occupa-

It is probable that Virgil or his patron, MaecenaS, had a
fancy also that by a poetical treatment of the art of hus-
bandry the humbler farmers might be encouraged to devote
themselves to renewing the waste places of the country, des-
olated by the civil wars. However this may be, doubtless
Virgil selected the topic chiefly because it afforded him an
opportunity, within the forms furnished by the GreekS‚ of
threading his poetical ideas upon a general subject, and one
with which he himself was familiar and which his rich patrons
would find pleasing from their own associations with the cul-
tivation of land. He speaks of himself as the Roman Hesiod,
but his aim is not, like that of the elder poet, to instruct
practically, but to interest through association. Hence he
in no case gives intelligible directions as to the complete
