produces obscurity. The quantity οξ syllables», as shown by
the metre, is often an easy guide to the construction ε as in
Ecl. i. 38, the long a in suli at once connects it with arbore ,-
the long i in sc'itis (Ecl. iii. 82) shows it to be the participle
οξ sero ,· the long i in omnis (id. 97) shows it to be the
accusative plura13 the long o in pb'pulus (vii. 61) shows its
meaning to be poplar‚ and not pcople. These examples might
be multiplied to almost any extent.

There are, however, many peculiarities οξ form and con·
struction. The most frequent οξ these—besides Gr'eek
forms οξ inflection —are ε (1) the omission οξ prepositionS,
especially with the locative ablative ; (2) the free use of the
dative in preference to other constructionS, aS, e.g., the accu-
sative οξ the end-of motion and (more rarely) result; (3) the
genitive (οξ specification) with adjectives ; (4) the constant
use οξ the infinitive (instead οξ the gerund or a clause) to
express purpose. In general, we may say that more is
demanded of the cases than the more highly developed con-
struction οξ prose will admit. Some οξ these forms and
constructions seem to be archaic‚ retained by a traditional
poetic dialect, as, for example, the omission οξ prepositions.1
Some οξ them are directly copied from the Greek, as many
cases οξ synecdochical accusative (ace. οξ specification). The
greatest number, however, are due to both these causes
combined, aS, e.g., the infinitive constructions.

METRICAL REAmNG. — A composition is not poetry un-
less it is in some manner metrical. Hence the first thing
to do is to read and feel poetry as having a distinct form οξ
verse. Beginners are often deterred from attempting the
metrical reading οξ strange forms οξ verse by the supposed
difficulties οξ the mette, but it ought not to be 80.

1 So in English. ‘⁶ lee trumpet spake not to the armbd throng is not anti-
quated {or poetry; although we should not write in a letter, ‘ He spake to me‚’ or
say, ‘ The British soldier is armed with the Enfield rifle! ”— Matthew Arnold,

Last Words, p. 21.
