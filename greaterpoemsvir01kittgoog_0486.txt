brothers (xiv. 231, xvi. 672). See Fig. 51 (from a vase—painting) which

 

represents the body of Memnon in the hands of the brothers Sleep and
Death. The idea is a favorite one with modern poets. Of countless
examples two typical ones may suffice :

Care-charmer Sleep‚ son of the sable Night,
Brother to Death, in silent darkness born.
DAmuL, Delia, sonnet xlv,

When in the down 1 sink my head,
Sleep‚ Death's twin-brother, times my brath3
Sleep‚ Death’s twin-brother, knows not Death‚
Nor can I dre'am of thee as dead.
Tnunvsou, In Memoriam, lxvii.
