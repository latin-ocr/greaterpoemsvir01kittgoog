w. 635] The AEneid. 347

610. Dirae: see v. 473. —diz the special or tutelary divinity, but why
more than one is not clear. Perhaps it was conceived as twofold3 hence
the expression Manes, and the custom of erecting two altars to the shade
(cf. iii. 63). The idea of divinities in pairs was a common Roman notion.

611. accipite, hear, as often. — haec, these my worth—meritum, as
I leave deserved (agreeing with numen). — malin advertite numen, turn
your power to (avenge) my sufferings.

612. The language of the curses that follow depends upon the com-

mon belief in the prophetie power (⁸⁴ second sight '') of a person at the
point of death and in the efficacy of a dying person's curse. —audite,
grant. .
615-620. at, at least. These are the· ominous lines which were
opened by Charles I, when he consulted the Sortes Vergilianae, at
Oxford. It'will be noticed that they are so worded that they do not
prevent the expedition of AEneas from being one of final glory and
success». The curses are literally fulfilled in the later fortunes of AEneas
(see the later books of the AEneid), including his reign of only three
yearS, and the loss of his body, which was swept away by the Numicius,
or at least was not found after the battle in which he per-ished.

H. 589, ii (497, i); H.-B. 502, 2.

629. ipsique nepotenque: i.e. may the warfare begin at once, and not
cease. e in -que is elided before the next verse (synapheia).
