lv, 4⁶0·] The AEneid. 339

436. quam . . . remittam for centuries an insoluble riddle. The
old interpretation is the most intelligible: When lte shall have granted
the favor (i.e. the short delay), J will repay it many sold (cumulatam)
by my death. Her death (which she has already spoken of, v. 385)
would be the best solution of the difficulty for AEneas, and so a boon;
not that she thinks of suicide, but she expects to die oi a broken beart.

437. talis, with fletus. —fletum tearfulprayers.

439. tractabilia, yielding.

440. placidas, kindly.

441. annoso robore: abl. of quality.

443. inter se, with each other.

444. concusso stipite: abl. abs.

445, 446. quantum, ete.= cf. Paradise Regained, iv, 416, 417:

whose tallest pines,
Though rooted deep as high.

449. mens, his purpose, as opposed to his feelings (pectus). —vol-
vuntur, are shed (by AEneas).—-inanes: because they are mere expres-
sions of feeling and do not affect his action. Thus translated by Waller:

And down his cheeks though fruitless tears do roll,
Unmoved remains the purpose of hin soul.

451. convexa: cf. strata viarum, i. 422.—tueri: see note on me,
v· 335·

452. quo magis peragat, etc„ that she may the more surely, etc.:
clause of purpose dependent on vidit, with the underlying idea that the
fates send these omens to drive her on to death; 5 531, a (317, b), B.
282, 1, a, G. 545; H. 568 (497, ii); H.-B. 502, 2 and b. Observe the
irregular sequence (cf. i. 298-3oo); the purpose construction easily
allows a primary sequence, but cum temporal must retain its imperfect.

455. cruorem: cf. the prodigy at Emelie's sacrifice in Chaucer's
K mgrht’s Tale, vv. 1478 ff.:

That other fyr was queynt [i.e. quenehed] and al agorn

And at the brondes ende oute ran anoon
As it were blody dropes many oon.

457. templum, a shrine (for the adoration of the manes of Sychaeus).
459. festa: such garlands were usual upon solemn occasions (v. 202).
460. hinc . . . voces, etc.: cf. Pope, Eloisa to Abelard, vv. 307-309:

Here, as 1 watch’d the dying lampa around,
From yonder shrine 1 heard a hollow sound.
‘⁸ Come, sister, eome,” it naid, or seem'd to ny.
