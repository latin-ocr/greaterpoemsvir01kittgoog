mare, maria, aestus, sal, salum, fluctus (sing. and plur.)‚ pontus, unda
undae, pelagus, freta, vada (salsa), vortex, gurges, are all used in essen·
tially the same meaning. Cf. Thomson's Seasons, Wnter:

'rhen issuez forth the storm with sudden burst,
And hurls the whole precipitated air

Down in a torrent. On the passive main
Descends the ethereal force, and with strong gust
Tumz from its bottom the discolored deep.

85. Eurusque, etc. ε the winds from all quarters are conceived as let
loose together, and by their simultaneous action in opposite directionS,
causing the storm, a natural enough conception in a cyclonic disturb-

87. virum: cf. superum, v. 4. ⁹

89. Teucrorum, the Trqjans: so called from Teucer, one of their
forefathers. As the Trojans have to be constantly mentioned, virgil,
for variety, uses all the names that can be made from the names of
their various ancestors or heroeS, or from anything else connected with
them (as Anchisiaden, Laomedontiadas, Dardani, ete.), just as the
Greeks are called by various -tribal nameS, Achivi, Danai, Argivi, etc.

Through the black night that sits immense around.

the glittering and the quivering effect of the flash.

92. solvuntur, etc., his limbs are paralyzed by tlze clzill qs terror (see
Od. v. 297; Bry. 356); the ancients betrayed their emotions in a far
more lively way than would be allowable in heroes of the present time.

His bold AEneas, on like billows tossed

In a tall ship, and all his country lost,
Dissolves with fear; and, both his hands upheld,
Proclaims them happy whom the Greeks had quelled
In honorable fight.
WALLER, Osthe Dangers his Mizjcsty E scaped, vv. 89—93.

93. duplicis palmas, both his hands. The ancient attitude of prayer
was not with clasped handS, but with the palms spread upward‚ as if to
receive the blessing ; hence the emphasis of the phrase “worship with
clean hand3.”
