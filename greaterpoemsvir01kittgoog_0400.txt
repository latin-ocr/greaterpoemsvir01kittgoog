‘⁴ real '')‚ a natural memorial of the old familiar places; cf. vv. 349 ff.

303. libabat: the indicative seems to violate the rule for cum in nar·
ration; but a definite past time is meant <just at the n'me when she was,
ete.), so that the violation is only apparent: ς 545 (325, α), Β. 288, 1, ας
G. 580; H. 601 (521, 11); Η.-Β. 550 and a.—Hanis: the spirit in its
semi-deifie'd condition would visit, like any divinity, the monument
erected to it, and receive the offering (cf. v. 84 ff.).

cenotaph erected to his memory. —caespitez ξ 403, 2, NJ (244, 2, N.1);

309· tempore: §42⁴ss (259, d): H· 4792 3 (423, N·²)·

310. vera . . . adfers, do you present youselfi a real form ?

311. recessit: if he is a spirit from below, then Hector might be
expected to appear in bodily form as well as he; cf. o. 303.

362, N.¹; H. 446, 1 (398, N.2); H.-B. 339, e.—Pyrrhin’: the omission

father’s tomb; see the Hecuba of Euripides, cf. Landor's poem, The
Espousals of Polyxena.
