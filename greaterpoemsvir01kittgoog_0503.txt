VI. 784.] The AEneid. 403

763. postuma. prole& youngest born ,· but in some legends Silvius is
called postumus as born after his father's death, in the woods to which
Lavinia had fled in fear of Ascanius (cf. the prediction, i. 263—271) ; and
this may be the sense here, though longaevo seems to make against it.

766. Longa Alba ε the ‘⁸ long white town,” stretched along a ridge on
the edge of Lake Albanus. It was supposed to be the old capital of
the Latin league‚ frorn which rank it was dispossessed by Rome. Other
Latin towns are mentioned below‚ Compare, for some of these legen·

772. umbrata quercu, wreatlzed with oak. The Oak-wreath (corona
civilis) was bestowed on him who had saved the life of a Roman
citizen in battle. (See figure of Augustu3‚ p. 181.) As perpetual
preserver of the people, such wreaths were hung before the door of
Augustus by vote of the Senate. Hence the allusion is a personal
compliment.
