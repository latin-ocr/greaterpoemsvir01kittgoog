Upon the wing, or in swift race contend‚

As at the Olympian games or Pythian fieldsg
Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal
With rapid wheels‚ or fronted brigads form.

Retreated in a silent valley, sing

With notes angeliml to many a harp
Their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
By doom of battle.
