Dmo Am> AENEAS.

In the episode of Dido, one of the most famous stories in all litera-
ture, Virgil has not only come nearer than any ancient writer to the
tone of modern romantic feeling (see Introduction, p. xx), but he has
delineated, with remarkable truth and delicacy of portraiture, the char·
aeter at once of a fond woman and an oriental queen. Doubtless the
poet owes something to the history of Antony and Cleopatra. The
defeat at Actium, the death of Mark Antony, and the death of Cleo-
patra had produced a powerful effect on the Roman imagination and
were fresh in all rnen's minds when this part of the AEneid was written.
The story of the Egyptian queen may well have suggested to Virgil
some traits in the character of the imperious Dido, and, in particular,
the passion of barbaric wrath, pride, and despair which closes her life.
Shakspere's Cleopatra may be compared with profit.

The episode of Dido has exercised a powerful effect on modern litera·
ture. of English versions of the story one of the most interesting is
that in Chaucer’s Legend qf Good Women, where the old tale is retold in
the spirit of mediaeval romance. Tasso in canto xvi of his jerusalem
Delivered has borrowed freely from this book of the AEneid.

1. at: contrasting Dido's restlessness with quievit, end of book iii.
—gravi . . . cura: notice the interlocked order and the placing of the
adjective before the caesura with the noun at the end; ξ 598, h (344, Ιι);
Β. 350, 11, d; G. 683.—cura: a regular word for the pangs of love.

2. alit venis: i.e. it feeds upon her blood.— carpitur, is consumed:
the image being of a flame, which cata-hes successively upon the objects
within its reach. Like care in v. 1, fire and flame are poetic conven-
tions; cf„ for example, Pope, Summe-73 v. 91 ε

On me love’s fiercer flames forever prey.
