about Robin Hood, which had already begun to gather into
cycleS, attaching themselves to various places (Sherwood, etc.)
where the legendary outlaw had been celebrated. The com-
biner has stitched his materials together loosely, but has
unified the style to some extent, and has left a work which
cannot very easily be resolved into its elements, in fact, an
epic. A more modern instance is that of the so-called
Finnish epic — the Kalevala. The scholar Lonnrot, in the
present century, took down from actual recitation a vast
number of heroic songS, and these he combined, with con·
siderable skill, into a single long poem of an epic character,
without, as he asserted, adding a line of his own. This
illustrates the adaptability of such legendary material to com-
binative literary treatment, and, no doubt, gives some idea
of what has actually been done in the case of older epics.

The AEneid is an epic in a very different sense, —
in what, for the sake of distinction, may be called the
’ literary sense. Though it has the foundation of traditions
and all the divine machinery of the true epiC, yet the tradi-
tions are no longer living; the divine machinery is no
longer a matter-ot belief. The traditions are dug out by
antiquarian research. The machinery is manufactured to
order, as it were, in a modern workshop. Many of the in·
cidents are labored invention, while the whole is written
with a definite purpose, as a work of art. These things put
it in a widely different class from the Iliad and Odyssey,
which serve in some sense as its modeIS, and with which it
has been oftenest compared. But still it is an imitation of
the popular epic, rests on similar traditions, has like
formulae of phrase and conventionalities of treatment, and
assumes the same mythical character.

And further, the purpose for which it was written dis-
tinguishes it clearly from other artificial epics and raises it
more nearly to the level of the epic proper. It was not
