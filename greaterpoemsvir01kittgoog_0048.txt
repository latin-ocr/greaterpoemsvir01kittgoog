Then bear in mind that this rhythm was in a manner sung
by the ancients and not said. That is, instead of being,

ffflffflffflffflffflff¹‘

it would be in Latin

rrrnrrrnrrrtrrrlrrrlrr '·

Now it is plain that only a long syllable (corresponding
to f ) can begin a foot or have an accent. Then (1) if a
short syllable appears, it must have another after it to make
up the foot, but (2) if a long syllable follows the accented
syllable, the foot is completed and another accent must come
in to begin a new foot. This seems difficult to make
out for a beginner‚ but enough quantities of syllables are
almost always determined by a few of the simplest rules to
show the structure of the verse. These rules are z

A diphthong is long.

Α, syllable in which a vowel is followed by two con-
sonants (except a mute with l or r) is long.

A vowel before another is short.

But we can hardly suppose the student, at this stage, to be
entirely ignorant of quantity. If he has been taught from the
first to pronounce long vowels long, or even if he has learned
the common paradigms and the accents of words in prose
which depend on quantity, he will know a great many more
quantities than those which are settled by these three rules.

The greatest trouble with beginners is that their ears are
not sensitive to hiatus, tle. they do not think to elide the
vowel or the syllable in m at the end of a word before a
following vowel. This must be learned by practice, and one
