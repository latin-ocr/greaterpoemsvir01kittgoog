gether (as in saffri'mus, uranie, glddlt't's). The necessities of
the metre often give rise to elisions which hurt the flow of
the verse (as in Ecl. ii. 2 5) or to artificial arrangement (as
in Ecl. i. 143 70). ,

Though this metre is con'structed on entirely different
principles from our own metreS‚ ‘the difficulty of reading it
is much less than is commonly supposed. It is true that
in Greek and Roman metres the element of time, the dif-
ferent duration of sound in the syllables, is the essential
matter, and with this duration of individual syllables our
modern ears are not familiar, and if they were, few beginners
i'n Virgil now-a-days have had the time to become masters
of Latin prosody so as torecognize the duration in each case.
But every* human being has a greater or less appreciation of
time; it is a part of the commonest heritage of humanit-y,
so that any vboy can follow a drum, and with a very little
trouble one can be made to apprehend the cadence of a
musical rhythm.

Half a dozen simple mles—with· which any one can become
familiar will suffice to make clear, with a few exceptions‚ any
hexameter line. Let the pupil‚ having of course learned the
mechanical ‘structure of the verse, become familiar through
some English hexameters with the succession‘ of accentual
ictus which marks our modern form of that metre.
