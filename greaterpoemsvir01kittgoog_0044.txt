xxxviii Directions for Reading.

The poetry of the ancients depends for its rhythm not
upon accent, but upon quantity. That is, it was in a manner
sung, and not read. A long vowel was to the ancients really
such, and occupied—in speech as well as in verse—twice
the time of a short one. Thus the first five lines of the
First Eelogue may be represented as follows :—

Nom— It must be remembered, however, that the long quantity marks as
here given do not indicate long vowels but long syllables. Many of the long
syllables have short vowels, but are made long by position, that is, by the
distinct and separate pronunciation of the consonants following the vowels.

The effect is to ηε, and must have been to the ancientS,
sornewhat monotonouS. But it is relieved by the variety of
dactyls and spondeeS, and also by the interruption of feet at
the end of words (caesura). Such interruptions were con-
sidered in Virgil’s time as absolutely necessary for an agree·
able cadence. One of these interruptions at the end of some
principal word, or at some pause in the sense, is more marked
than the rest, and is called The Coesura (see Grammar,
ὃ 362, b). This main caesura is often a great help to the
sense, and must always be observed as an important part
