 

iv â€˜ Preface.

of literary tradition a large number of passages from modern
poetry covering a wide range have been inserted in the
notes. These passages are either direct imitations of Virgil
or they deal with ideas suggested by his works. A fuller
explanation of Virgil's metrical form and more detailed
directions for reading have also been added.
