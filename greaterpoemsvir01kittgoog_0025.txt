Virgil’s Works. xix

VIRGIL'S WORKS.

The works ascribed to Virgil, besides the doubtful Car-

mina Minora, viz.:

Culex, a kind of idyllic epic, of some merit,

Ciris, a poetical version of the story of Nisus and Scylla, in
the manner of Ovid's Metamorphoses,

Mor-etum, a kind of idyl representing the preparation of the
moretum, a rustic salad,

Copa, an invitation in elegiae verse to the pleasures of the
tavern‚

and some still more doubtful little poems (catalecta ¹), are

the following, which are unquestionably genuine ε The

EclogueS, Bucolica ‚· the GeorgicS, Georgica,· the AEneid,

Aeneis.

The subjects and characters of these works are very
various, and they represent several different periods in
Virgil's literary career3 but they were all composed more
or less under the influence of the Alexandrian school, of the
general effect of which upon Latin literature in the Augustan
age something has been already said.

With the Alexandrian writers Virgil obviously became
acquainted very early. Parthenius, his instructor in Greek,
was of that school, though he was not himself an Alexandrian.
He came to Rome in 72 B.C. as a prisoner, but was evidently
freed, and lived in Naples when Virgil came in contact with
him. He was a very voluminous author, though his works
are now mostly lost. Virgil's Moretum is an imitation of an
idyl of his master. The Eclogues are imitations of Theo-
critus, who was of the same school. The Georgics were
modelled after a work of the same name by Nicander of
Colophon, also of the school, and the AEneid was no doubt
influenced as much by the Argonautica of Apollonius of

1 ny some supposed to be Καταληπτά.
