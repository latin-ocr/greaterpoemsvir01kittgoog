It may be rendered, on the other hand the commands, etc„ warn us [lit.
the ships] nat to hold our course between Scylla and Charybdis, with little
chance of escape frona death either way (i.e. towards whichever side of
the passage we steer). ni is to be taken in the sense of ne by an anti-
quated usage. The wind is evidently southerly, so that to follow their
first thought (metus acer agit) and run before the wind (secundis)
would bring them into the Straits of Messina between Scylla and
Charybdis. Apparently they could not go south on account of the
wind, for their ships could not lie as close to the wind as our modern
craft.

685. viam: in apposition with Scyllam atque Charybdin.

686. tetro, directly back whence they carne, as their only other course
with a southerly wind was eastward again.
