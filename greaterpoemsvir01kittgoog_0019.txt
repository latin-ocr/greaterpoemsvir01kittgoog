Life qf Virg il. xiii

L1rE or VIRGIL.

By general consent, Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro) stands
first in rank' among the writers of this flourishing period.

He was born B.c. 70, in AndeS, in the municipality of Man-
tua, in North Italy}

Domrrus’s Vita Vergilii. - The life of Virgil which passes
under the name of one AElius Donatus, a work doubtless
originally ‘ founded on fact,' but much distorted and ampli-
fied in the building, is our chief source for details in regard
to the poet. According to this, he was the son of humble
parents, His father was said by some to have been a work·
man in pottery, by others a hired servant of one MagiuS, by
whom he was entrusted with important business and later
made his son-in-law. Many omens preceded Virgil's birth,
and as an infant he gave signs of a happy destiny. His
boyhood was passed at Cremona up to his 15th (or 17th)
year, when he assumed the virile toga (the Roman boy's
‘coming out '). The text here is evidently corrupt. Probably
the time at Cremona was the last two or three years of his
boyhood‚ during the completion of his early education.
From here, the author says, he went to Milan (a still larger
city with superior advantages), and shortly afterwards to
Naples. Here he gave his most urgent attention to Greek
and Latin literature, but was very zealous also in the pursuit
of medicine and mathematics. Having become unusually
learned and skilful in these branches of study, he went to
Rome, where he became acquainted with the head groom of
Augustus and practised veterinary medicine in the imperial
stables. Hereupon he received as pay regular rations of
bread as one of the groomS. A colt was sent to Augustus,

¹ Five years before Horace, and seven before Augustus. His birthday is said
to have been October ις.
