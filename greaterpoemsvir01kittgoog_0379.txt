3583 H. 428, 1 (385, 4, 1); H.-B. 375.

690. hoc tantum: supply precor or the like.

691. deinde: i.e. after having looked upon us and judged our case. —
firma: i.e. by some fresh omen. In augury it was customary to wait for
a second omen. This, if of similar meaning, confirmed the first; if of
contrary meaning, it neutralized it.

692. -quez here used like cum in inverted temporal clauses (see v. 680,
note).

693. intonuit laevum: ἦ 390, b (238, a); Β. 176, 2, N.; G. 333, N.⁰;
H. 409, 1 (371, ii) ; 11:13. 396, 2, a. Thunder on the left was a favorable
sign in Roman augury (see ii. 54, note). Cf. Landor, Death os Paris and

OEmme ο When she had spoken, on the leit was heard

Thunder, and there shone flame from sky serene.

694. stella: i.e. of course, a shooting-star or meteor, a phenomenon
always regarded with superstition by the ancients. — facem ducens,
drawing a trail of light, like a firebrand (fax) waved in the hand.

695. illam, the star: notice how the Latin, by the skilful use of pro·
nouns, avoids repetition; in English we cannot secure the emphasis
here by using a pronoun, as the Latin does.

696. Idaea silva: marking the place of gathering. ’ The light, says
ServiuS, signified the future glory of the house; the fiery trail, that
some would stay behind; the length of the path, their long voyage ς the
furrow (sulcus), that it must be by sea; and the sulphur-smoke, the
death of AEneas, or the war in Italy. Probably the Trojans did not see
so much in the omen. — claram, still bnght.

704. cedo, I resist no more. —equidem only emphasizes the words,

706. aestus, ete„ the surging flames roll the conflagration nearer ,· it
seems best to take aestus as subject rather than incendia.

707. ergo age: observe the haste marked by the abruptness and

rapid movement of the verse. —— imponere, place yourseff (imperative
pass. in “middle ’' sense, cf. v. 633, note).
