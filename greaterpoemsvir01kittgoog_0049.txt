will soon become as sensitiva to the clash of vowels as the
Romans themselves, If we can remember that the Romans
always would say th’ethereal instead of occastbnally as we do,
the difficulty will disappear‚ especially if we remember also
that they never, in rapid utterance‚ pronounced the m at the
end of a word, and in some manner made such words end
in a (nasalized) vowel before another vowel.

Now with these ideas let us attack the first lines of the
AEneid. Remember first that the long syllable and the ictus
(accent) always begins, not, as in the most common English
rhythms‚ comes second ε

Arma virumque cano Troiae qui primus ab oris.

The first syllable must always be a long one. Then to com·
plete the foot (or to be ready for another ictus) we need one
long or two short syllables. We ought to know by our para-
digms that the a of the neuter plural is short. So another
syllable is required and vi· must be short also, leaving the
ictus to fall on -rum.

We ought to know also that the enclitics are short. So
-que must have another syllable to match it and the ictus
comes again on ·n0. We may not perhaps know that Tro- is
long, but we do know that ae is a diphthong and so cannot
be joined to Tro· to make the next foot. Hence another -foot
must begin with -ae, and the rest of the line can only be the
regular close. Hence the reading must be

A'rma viln'unque caluo Troliae qui Ι primus ab 1 oris.

So with the second line,
Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit.

As the second i is short before another vowel, we must have
the first three syllables to make the first foot‚ and the second
