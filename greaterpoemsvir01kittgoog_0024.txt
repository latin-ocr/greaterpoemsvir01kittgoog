Octavia swooned away; and when she recovered, it is said,
ordered 1o,ooo sesterces (about 3500) to be paid to the poet
for each of the memorial lineS.

When the AEneid in its general plan was brought to a
close,—many parts being still left unfinished in detail,—
virgil set out on a journey to Greece‚ that he might give
the leisure of a few years to its careful revision, and then
devote the remainder of his life to philosophy. It was this
voyage to which Horace wished prosperity in the celebrated

Ode, Sic te diva potens Cypri. (Od. i. 3.)

But AugustuS, arriving soon after at Athens from the
East‚ prevailed on Virgil to go back with him to Italy. This
journey proved fatal to him. He was tall, spare, swarthy,
and of consumptive temperament. His delicate lungs hardly
bore the harsh air of the coast, while his frame was racked
with sea-sickness and worn with the fatigue ot* a visit to
Megara on the homeward voyage. He barely lived to reach
Italy, and died at Brundusium, September 22, B.C. 19, aged
not quite 51. Unwilling to leave the AEneid in its unfinished
state, he is said to have ordered it to be burned, and to
have hardly yielded to the request of Augustus that it might
be left to the judgment and revision of his friends, Tucca
and Varius, He was buried, by his own desire, near Naples.
At the erest of the rock that overhangs the grotto of Posilip0,
beneath a low ivy-grown roof of stone, was formerly said to
be the modest epitaph :—

MANTVA ME GENVIT: CALABRI RAPVERE: TENET NVNC
PARTHENOPE= CECINI PAsch RVRA DVCES,

no doubt of a later date. The exact place of his burial is
not certain.
