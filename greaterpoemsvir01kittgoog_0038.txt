xxxii Introduction.

mette on classical models testifies to the reverence in which
Virgil was held. This attempt (with which the names of
Gabriel Harvey and Sir Philip Sidney are inseparably asso-

repudiation of 'other eighteenth century ideaIS, Virgil too
had been neglected. But, though the present century has
made into an article of saith what was at one time an article
of convention—the superiority of Homer in the higher
qualities of poetry—the position of Virgil still remains
secure. The general abandonment by modern poets of the
machinery of classical mythology has resulted in his being
less often imitated, but he still serves as a standard of
chaste and sels-restrained art by which, consciously or un·
