regna) of a hostile people (Liburnorum).

244. superare, pass beyond, but with the suggestion of surmounting
difficulties. Cf Ecl. viii. 6.

245. per ora novem. Venus pauses in her appeal to describe a
curious natural phenomenon. The Timavus is the name of a small
river and bay, or creek, at the head of the Adriatie‚ where several springs
-the actual number is seven—flow by underground channels in the
limestone into the salt water. When the waters are forced back by a
storm, the salt water finds its way through these creviceS, so as to dis-
gorge ‘⁸ with roaring flood '' through the springs upon the land, —pelago
premit arva sonanti.

248. arma fixit: i.e. in the templeS, in gratitude for the peace which

implement of an abandoned vocation was made a votive offering. So
in Ecl. vii. 24.

249. compostus, undisturbed (lit. settled to rest after the turmoils of

of Antenor. The words are capable of either meaning (see Vocabulary).

Liv. i. 2).

(445, 4); Η.-Β. 326, 1; is this the honor shown to piety?-—reponi8‚

what, is not piety exempt from woe?
