THE exiles sail in early summer, and arrive at Thrace, but are
alarmed by the prodigy of a bleeding thicket over Polydorus’s grave
(vv. 1-68). At Delos they consult Apollo, and (misunderstanding his
oracle) settle in Crete, whence they are driven by a pestilence (69-146).
AEneas is warned in a vision that Italy is the destined land: they set
sail, but are overtaken by a storm (147—208). Seeking shelter at the
Strophades, they are driven thence by the HarpieS‚ and follow the coast
as far as Epirus (209-293). Here they find Helenus and Andromache,-
who joyfully receive them in hospitality (294-355)· The prophecy of
Helenus: they depart, laden with gifts (3 56— 50 5). They hail the coast
of Italy, and proceed till they near Sicily and the residence of the Cy-
clops: the spectacle of Mount AEtna (506-587). Here they rescue one
of the companions of Ulysses. The monster Polyphemus is seen ap·
proaching the shore: his eries summon his companions (588-681). Re·
tracing their course, to avoid Scylla and Charybdis, they land at the
port of Drepanum: the death of Anchises (682-718).
