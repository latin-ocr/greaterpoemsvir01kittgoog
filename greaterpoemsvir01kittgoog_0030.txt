or which would probably be of much service to the Romans

THE AENEm. — The third and last work, the AEneid, has
stood for many centuries as 3 model of epic poetry. Properly

tradition, which has taken form in the mind and language of
a people; and which, while the traditions were yet living and

figures — legendary warriors, old kings or ehiefs} Such
poems may be called ballads, though this term includes much
