Virga? 's Fame. xxxi

Ever since the revival of letterS‚ and indeed ever since
his death, partly through the spell of his name and partly
from real appreciation of his greatneSS, his works have
exercised a wider and deeper influence on literature than
any other book, except perhaps the Bible.

From the time of Chaucer (1340 ?- 1400) the influence of
Virgil on English literature has been almost continuouS.
Chaucer, who was a student of Dante and an admirer of
Petrarch and Boccaccio, the leaders of the revival of learn-
ing in Italy, is outspoken in his admiration for Virgil. He
summarizes a large part of the AEneid at the beginning of
his Housc os Fame. In his Legend of Gooa' Women he tells
the story of Dido, treating it in true mediaeval fashion as an
episode of faithless chivalric love. The perfectiori of fo'rm
and sense of artistic restraint which distinguish the best
poetry of Chaucer are doubtless in some measure due to his
enthusiastic study of Virgil.

The second period of Italian influence in our literature
shows the influence of Virgil in the most signal manner.
The Earl of Surrey (1517 ?- 1547) translated books ΙΙ. and
IV. of the AEneid into blank verse (an early specimen of this
metre), and throughout the Elizabethan age the greatness of
Virgil was never questioned. His influence on the litera·
ture of this time was exerted both directly and also indi-
rectly through the medium of the Italians of the Renais-
sance. Spenser (1552-1599), who was in many ways a
marked contrast to Virgil, but who resembled him in the
seriousness of his moral and religious purpose and in the
purity of his ideals‚ not only imitated his Eclogues (in the
Shepherds' Calendar), but continually reproduces bits of the
AEneid in his Faery Queen. The heroic and the bucolic
poets of the seventeenth century, much affected by the
Italians and by Spenser‚ acknowledged Virgil as their mas-
ter. Even the unsuccessful attempt to reconstruct English
