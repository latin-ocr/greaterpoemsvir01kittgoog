gods; for although they thwarted him to please Jun0, yet they meant
in the end that he should succeed.

193, 13 G. 347, R.¹; Η. 428, 1 (385, 4); H.-B. 376, 377, 1-3. Latium
is the undulating plain between the Sabine mountains and the sea; its
inhabitants are called Latini, and its language Latin. The name was
thought to be derived from an ancient king, Latinus, but in fact the
king is mythical, he is a so-called eponymous here, i.e. one invented to
account for the name—Latinum. The Latin race existed before the
arrival of AEnea33 but in Virgil's time it had long been incorporated
with Rome, and many great families traced their descent from it, he
therefore represents the whole as if sprung from Troy.

7. Albani patres. Alba Longa was the head of the Latin league of
thirty confederate towns, When conquered by Rome, its leading fam·
ilies, Albani patres, were said to have been transferred to Rome, which
then became chief of the confederacy. The term refers here, in gen·
eral, to the great senatorial families,

8. Busa, etc. Virgil follows the regular epie method, invoking the
Muse and referring all the plot to the gods. Cf. Bry. quoted in note
on v. 1. — quo numine laeso. Of this vexed passage the meaning seems
to be, what purpose [of Juno] having been thwarted s? The answer is in
vv. 12—22, as that to quid dolens is in vv. 23-28 iri inverse order. The
two causes, then, were that AEneas hindered her plans and that he was
personally hateful to her. This view agreesbest with the etymology of
numen, the will or power of the gods as expressed by their nod (nuo).

9. quidve dolena, feeling pain at what: dolere is often transitive in
prose also; see ς 388, a (237, b); B. 176, 1, a 3 G. 330, ml, H. 405 (371,

as a destined circle which AEneas goes through.’' For the infinitive

10. pietate: §404 (245); Β. 2ι9; G. 4083 H. 475 (416); H.-B.444;
i.e. his filial devotion in the rescue of his father, as well as his piety
towards the gods. The gods could pursue with vengeance even a pious
man, either because under the power of F ate he thwarted their pur-
poses, or because his ancestors had committed crimes, as was the case
with the descendants of Pelops, Both causes existed in the case of
· AEneas (see the story of Laomedon).—labores: ξ 370, b (228, a); B.
